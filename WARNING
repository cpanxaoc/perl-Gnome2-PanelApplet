			WARNING WARNING WARNING

	This module compiles correctly, but IT DOES NOT WORK.

			WARNING WARNING WARNING

As far as I understand panel applets, libpanelapplet-2.0 and bonobo, the
GClosure created inside panel_applet_bonobo_factory (xs/PanelApplet.xs:131)
is never called.  The problem is that tracing and debugging the applet code is
made difficoult by the fact that every operation takes place inside a bonobo
session.

If someone with better understanding of the bonobo and/or libpanelapplet
internals is willing to give a hand in making this module working, should
contact the gtk2-perl mailing list or me.
